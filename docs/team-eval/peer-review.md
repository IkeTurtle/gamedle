## [Eike Gebing] - review 1

### My observation (Wahrnehmung)

Working with Quang has been a very fruitful experience. We provide each other with a clear division of labour depending on our strengths and weaknesses. While I was mainly focusing on Frontend Design Quang did a good job on the Database Logic and Routing. Quang is a goal driven person who knows how to effectively finish what needs to be done in time.

Sometimes I have felt that we could have explained our thought processes a bit clearer, as we were too caught up in what we were doing.

### Effect on me (Wirkung)

Our group dynamic pushed me to try and make a product, which we could be proud of. I especially tried to realize the ideas and efforts Quang was providing in the Design and flow of our website as best a possible.

### Tip for the future (Wunsch)

We both could have started on certain tasks a bit earlier. While we certainly didn't start too late, some features we thought would be easier to implement took us longer than we expected and forced us to make cuts on other parts of our app.

## [Quang Anh Nguyen] - review 2

### My observation (Wahrnehmung)

Working on this project definitely provided with me certain challenges I was not expecting at first. I had previous knowledge with databases that I had gathered in our previous database course which I pretty confident in. Regardless I found the these hurdles and obstacles that I had to overcome together with Eike as a valuable learning experience. I managed to acquire new knowledge in setting up our own Web-App. Eike managed to handle the the Design well while I was able to focus on making sure that the Backend archtitecture worked properly.

### Effect on me (Wirkung)

As already mentioned I am taking alot of technical knowledge with me into my future. Our teamwork showed that a clear division of labor is useful and can bring decent outcomes. I was able to focus on my tasks while Eike and me made sure to stay on track in order to deliver practical results.

### Tip for the future (Wunsch)

I would like to develop projects like this a bit more in depth and see what the other end of development at the frontend side looks like.

## [Eike Gebing] - review 1

### My observation (Wahrnehmung)

Working with Quang has been a very fruitful experience. We provide each other with a clear division of labour depending on our strengths and weaknesses. While I was mainly focusing on Frontend Design Quang did a good job on the Database Logic and Routing. Quang is a goal driven person who knows how to effectively finish what needs to be done in time.

Sometimes I have felt that we could have explained our thought processes a bit clearer, as we were too caught up in what we were doing.

### Effect on me (Wirkung)

Our group dynamic pushed me to try and make a product, which we could be proud of. I especially tried to realize the ideas and efforts Quang was providing in the Design and flow of our website as best a possible.

### Tip for the future (Wunsch)

We both could have started on certain tasks a bit earlier. While we certainly didn't start too late, some features we thought would be easier to implement took us longer than we expected and forced us to make cuts on other parts of our app.

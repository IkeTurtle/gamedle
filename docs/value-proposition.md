## The problem

Currently there is a vast sea of distractions that can be more or less valuable and mentally engaging for modern internet users. 

In this ocean of possibilities of options to pass a couple of minutes in their daily routine, it is challenging for most people to identify the choices that combine ease of access and engaging content, which does not make the user feel like they have wasted their time on "just another stupid game".

Often these games are expertly designed to capture our attention, but leave us feeling like we are not actively straining our mental capacities. Rather they feel like they suppress our thoughts and worsen our ability to concentrate.

Most solutions to this problems also require an unwanted sign-up process that first has to be completed for the user to get a full experience. This is most often the case when the user wants to compare his/her statistics in the application to that of other users such as friends or colleagues.

## Our solution

[Describe why and how your app solves the stated problem. Don't over-promise: the description should match what your app actually delivers.]

## Target user

[Scope your target user(s), e.g., with the help of personas.]

## Customer journey

[Illustrate the customer journey, from the app's entry point to a completed task. You might want to show the customer journey as (schematic) screen flows.]
